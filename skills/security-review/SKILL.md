# Security Review

Not a pentest methodology — these are the reflexes that fire while writing
ordinary code. Scan the diff you're producing against whichever sections
its surfaces touch.

## Input crossing a trust boundary

Any value originating from a user, client, LLM, or external system:

- **Parameterize, never concatenate**: SQL via placeholders; shell via
  array-arg APIs (no string-built commands); paths via join + canonicalize
  + prefix check (traversal: `../`).
- **Validate at the boundary, by allowlist**: enums/slugs mapped through a
  server-side whitelist — especially LLM-generated values headed into
  external APIs (see llm-app-code). Reject unexpected keys, not just
  missing ones.
- **HTML**: rendering user/model text as raw HTML is an XSS. Keep markdown
  renderers raw-HTML-off; escape by default.
- **URLs the server will fetch**: validate scheme+host against an allowlist
  (SSRF) — a user-supplied URL fetched server-side can reach internal
  services and metadata endpoints.

## AuthN / AuthZ

- Every mutating endpoint: WHO is calling (authentication) and MAY they
  touch THIS object (authorization — ownership check on the specific
  row/resource, not just "is logged in"). The missing per-object check is
  the IDOR that review after review sails past.
- Never trust client-supplied identity/scope fields (user IDs, account IDs,
  role flags, prices, approved-params). The server derives them from the
  session or its own records.
- Approval flows: bind execution to a server-recorded intent; the client
  conveys a reference, never the parameters.

## Secrets

- Secrets come from env/secret managers only — never hardcoded, never in
  client bundles (watch framework prefixes that expose env to the browser),
  never in logs (including "debug" logs of full request/response objects),
  never in error messages echoed to users.
- External API errors: wrap/sanitize before showing users — raw provider
  errors leak internal detail.
- Never ask for or accept credentials that identify a human irreversibly
  (private keys, seed phrases), even "just to test".

## Dangerous defaults to catch in review

- `JSON.parse`/deserialization of external input without try/catch and
  shape validation.
- Comparing secrets with `==`/`===` (timing) where a constant-time compare
  exists — matters for tokens and signatures.
- Missing rate limiting or size caps on endpoints that do expensive work or
  send messages.
- CORS `*` on authenticated routes; cookies without
  httpOnly/secure/sameSite thought.
- Temp files or predictable paths for sensitive data; world-readable perms.

## When the change is security-relevant by nature

If the diff touches auth flows, crypto, session handling, or permission
checks: slow down, find the existing pattern in the codebase and match it
exactly (bespoke crypto/session logic is almost always the bug), and say
explicitly in your report which security property you preserved and how you
verified it.

## Escalate, don't improvise

Discovering an existing vulnerability mid-task → report it clearly (what,
where, exploitability) rather than silently fixing beyond scope or ignoring
it (see escalate-vs-decide). Destructive proof-of-concepts and exploit
tooling need explicit authorization context.
