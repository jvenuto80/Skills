  What to test and how: regression tests that fail first, boundary tables,
  behavior over implementation, boundary-only mocks, and the mock-echo
  trap. Use when writing tests, adding regression coverage for a fix,
  reviewing test quality, or judging whether existing tests protect
  anything. Keywords: unit test, regression test, test coverage, mocking,
  TDD, assertions, test design, flaky tests.

# Test Design

A test's value is the bug it would catch. Write tests by asking "what
realistic mistake would make this fail?" — a test no plausible mistake can
fail is ballast.

## What to test (priority order)

1. **The bug you just fixed** — a regression test that fails on the pre-fix
   code. Write it FIRST, watch it fail, then fix. A "regression test" that
   never failed proves nothing; if you fixed first, temporarily revert the
   fix to confirm the test goes red.
2. **The contract, at its boundaries** — for each input: empty/zero/null,
   one, many, max, just-past-max, wrong type/shape, duplicate,
   unicode/whitespace where strings (see edge-case-sweep). Use a table:
   input → expected. Boundaries are where implementations disagree with
   intentions.
3. **The failure paths** — what the code does when its dependency errors,
   times out, or returns malformed data. Untested error handling is usually
   broken error handling.
4. **The invariant** — properties that must hold across all inputs (sorted
   output stays sorted, money sums preserved, scrubbed text contains no
   digits). One property test or loop-over-cases beats five example tests.

## Test behavior, not implementation

Assert on observable outcomes (return values, emitted events, state visible
to callers, rendered output) — not on internals (which private method was
called, internal ordering, exact intermediate structure).
Implementation-coupled tests break on every refactor while catching no
bugs, training everyone to update tests reflexively — which is how real
regressions slip through.

Heuristic: could someone rewrite the function body correctly and keep your
test green? They should be able to.

## Mock discipline

- Mock at the boundary you don't own (network, clock, randomness,
  filesystem) — not your own logic. Mocking your own modules tests the
  mocks.
- **The mock-echo trap**: a test that stubs `getX` to return `42` and then
  asserts the result contains `42` tests nothing but the stub. Every mocked
  test needs some real logic under test between stub and assertion.
- Fix time and randomness explicitly (injected clock/seed) — tests that
  pass "most of the time" are worse than no tests.
- Keep mock shapes honest: when the real dependency's response shape
  changes, grep for its mocks — a green suite against a stale mock is a
  false green.

## Structural rules

- One behavior per test; the name states the expectation ("rejects expired
  proposal") not the method ("test handleProposal 2").
- Arrange–act–assert, visible in the test body. Shared setup helpers are
  fine; shared *assertions* hidden in helpers obscure what's protected.
- Tests must not depend on each other or on execution order; each builds
  its own state and cleans up (or uses fresh fixtures).
- Deterministic first: no real network, no real sleeps (use fake timers),
  no shared global state across files.

## Calibrate quantity

A tiny pure function needs 1–3 boundary cases, not twelve. A gnarly state
machine or money-handling path deserves the full table + failure paths + an
invariant. Match the project's existing test idioms and runner conventions —
a beautifully designed test in the wrong framework style is a maintenance
burden.
