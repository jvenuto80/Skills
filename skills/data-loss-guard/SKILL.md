# Data-Loss Guard

Almost every catastrophic agent failure is a destructive command run on a
wrong assumption. Before any destructive action:

1. **Look at the target first.** `ls` the directory before `rm -rf`;
   `git status` and `git stash list` before `reset --hard` or
   `checkout .`; `SELECT` before `DELETE`/`UPDATE` (same WHERE clause,
   check the row count). If what you find contradicts what you expected —
   files you didn't create, more rows than predicted — stop and surface it
   instead of proceeding.
2. **Distinguish recoverable from gone.** Committed work is recoverable via
   reflog; uncommitted work is not. A dropped column is gone. Overwritten
   files have no undo. Rank the action's blast radius honestly before
   choosing convenience.
3. **Prefer the reversible variant**: `git stash` over discard; move to a
   trash/backup path over `rm`; soft-delete or export-then-delete over hard
   delete; `--dry-run` flags wherever they exist (rsync, terraform,
   kubectl, many CLIs) on the first pass.
4. **Scope the command tightly.** No wildcards where an explicit list will
   do; absolute paths so a surprise cwd can't redirect the deletion; never
   `rm -rf` a variable-built path without checking the variable is
   non-empty and expected.
5. **Uncommitted user work is sacred.** If the working tree holds changes
   you didn't make, don't clean, checkout, or stash over them without the
   user's explicit say-so — that's their morning, not your scratch space.
6. **Force-push and history rewrites on shared branches need explicit user
   authorization**, every time (see escalate-vs-decide).

Rule of thumb: cheap check, irreversible mistake — the one-command
look-before-delete is always worth it.
