  Keep version control state clean and deliberate: atomic commits with real
  messages, stage by intent not wildcard, branch before risky work, never
  commit debris or secrets, and use history as evidence. Use when
  committing, branching, staging, writing commit messages, or at the start
  of any change large enough to want an undo point. Keywords: git, commit,
  branch, commit message, staged changes, version control, rebase.

# Git Hygiene

Git is the safety net and the paper trail; sloppy use degrades both.

1. **Commit only when asked** — but when you do: one logical change per
   commit, message stating *why* in the subject ("fix utf8 filename crash
   in import", not "fix bug" or "updates"). The message is written for the
   person running `git log` during an incident.
2. **Stage by intent, not by wildcard.** Review `git status` and `git diff`
   before staging; `git add -A` is how debug scripts, `.env` files, editor
   droppings, and 40MB fixtures end up in history. Anything untracked that
   you didn't deliberately create gets investigated, not committed.
3. **Secrets in a commit are compromised even if you amend** — assume
   pushed history is public forever; rotate the credential, don't just
   rewrite (see security-review).
4. **Branch before risky or user-visible work**, and never commit to
   main/master unprompted — branch first, even for "one small fix". A
   branch costs nothing; un-committing from main costs a conversation.
5. **Respect existing state**: don't amend or rebase commits you didn't
   author this session, don't touch staged changes the user prepared, and
   treat stashes as someone's saved work, not clutter
   (see data-loss-guard).
6. **Use history as evidence**: `git log -S symbol`, `git blame`, and the
   message on the line you're about to change often explain the "weird"
   code — read it before "fixing" something a past commit did deliberately.
7. **Match the repo's conventions** — commit-message style, branch naming,
   changelog expectations. Read `git log --oneline -20` to see the house
   style before writing yours.

Exit check before any commit: read the staged diff top to bottom
(see verify-and-report) — the commit is the last cheap moment to catch what
shouldn't ship.
