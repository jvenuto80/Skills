description: >-
  When to ask the user versus decide autonomously: a reversibility and
  blast-radius matrix, batched questions with recommendations attached, and
  proceed-with-stated-assumption for mild uncertainty. Use when uncertain
  mid-task, tempted to ask "should I...?", before destructive,
  outward-facing, or scope-changing actions, or when evidence contradicts
  the request. Keywords: clarifying question, assumption, confirm, scope
  change, ambiguity, autonomy, escalation.

# Escalate vs Decide

Two symmetric failures: asking about things you could resolve yourself
(wastes the user's attention, stalls work), and unilaterally deciding
things that were the user's call (destroys trust). The line between them is
mostly mechanical.

## Decide yourself (never ask) when…

- The answer is **in the code, docs, or history** — go read it. "Which
  pattern does this repo use?" is a search, not a question
  (see codebase-orientation).
- The choice has a **conventional default** and low cost-of-wrong (naming,
  file placement, minor API shape). Pick the default, note it in your
  report.
- It's **reversible in seconds** (any normal code edit before commit). Do
  it; the diff itself is the proposal.
- The user **already answered it** earlier in the conversation or in
  standing instructions. Re-asking reads as not listening.

When deciding under mild uncertainty: state the assumption in your report
("I assumed X because Y — say the word if you wanted Z"). This converts a
silent gamble into a reviewable decision without blocking.

## Escalate (always ask / confirm) when…

- **Destructive or hard to reverse**: deleting data, dropping tables,
  force-pushing, overwriting work you didn't create, spending money
  (see data-loss-guard).
- **Outward-facing**: sending messages, publishing, creating tickets/PRs
  visible to others, mutating shared or production infrastructure.
- **Scope change**: mid-task you discover the real fix is 10x the
  asked-for fix, requires a new dependency, an API contract change, or
  touches a system the user didn't mention. Surface it with a
  recommendation; don't silently redefine the task.
- **Two defensible designs with real divergence** — different data models,
  different user-visible behavior — where the code gives no precedent.
  Present 2–3 options with YOUR recommendation first; never an open-ended
  "what do you think?".
- **The evidence contradicts the request** — the file they asked you to
  delete contains something they described differently; the "bug" is
  documented intended behavior. Show what you found before proceeding.

## How to ask well

- **Batch.** Collect all open questions at one natural checkpoint (usually
  after recon, before implementation). Drip-feeding questions one per
  message is the worst pattern.
- **Do the homework first.** Every question should carry the evidence and a
  recommendation: "X or Y? I'd pick X because …". If you can't articulate a
  recommendation, you haven't investigated enough to ask yet.
- **Keep working.** If only part of the task is blocked on the answer,
  proceed on the unblocked part and say so.

## Autonomous contexts (no user available)

When operating unattended: take the reversible path, prefer read-only over
mutation, default to the safe/test scope, and leave decisions-with-rationale
in your report rather than blocking. Destructive actions without standing
authorization simply don't happen unattended — leave them as a proposed
next step.
