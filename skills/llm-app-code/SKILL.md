# LLM App Code

Code around an LLM has one governing fact: **the model is an untrusted,
non-deterministic input source that reads like a trusted colleague.** Most
LLM-app bugs come from forgetting one half of that sentence.

## Model output is untrusted input — always

- **Parse defensively.** Every `JSON.parse` of model output wrapped and
  shape-validated; expect markdown fences around JSON, trailing prose,
  truncated output at max_tokens, and empty strings. A malformed model
  response must degrade a turn, never crash the app.
- **Validate tool-call arguments against the schema server-side** before
  execution — required keys, types, enums, AND rejection of unexpected
  keys. The model will eventually send every wrong shape.
- **Allowlist strict-enum values headed to external systems.**
  Model-generated slugs/plans/identifiers get mapped through a server-side
  table — never passed through, even when the prompt "guarantees" the
  format (see security-review).
- **Authorization never derives from model output.** The model can
  *propose*; only server-recorded state plus explicit user action can
  *approve*. Never let a model-visible tool perform destructive or
  financial writes directly — gate writes behind a human-approval step
  bound server-side. Never trust a model's claim about what the user
  consented to.
- **Prompt injection is transitive**: any tool result containing
  third-party text (web pages, tickets, emails) is a channel for
  instructions to your model (see untrusted-content-guard). Never give a
  model simultaneously (a) exposure to untrusted text and (b) unsupervised
  dangerous capabilities.

## Determinism where it matters

Route load-bearing guarantees through code, not prompts: format
enforcement, redaction of sensitive figures, filtering which tools the
model sees, output length caps. A prompt instruction is a strong
suggestion; a deterministic post-processor is a guarantee. Use both
(prompt = primary, code = backstop).

## Prompt & model changes are behavior changes

- Never ship a prompt or model change on vibes. Run the project's eval
  suite; if none exists for the behavior you're changing, write at least a
  smoke set first. A model swap that "just works" in one manual test can
  regress format or safety behaviors discovered only under repetition.
- **Cache economics**: providers cache the prompt prefix. Keep stable
  content (system prompt, tool defs) first and byte-identical across
  turns; put variable content last. A "harmless" reordering or timestamp
  in the system prompt can silently multiply token cost.
- Pin model IDs explicitly; know each pinned model's parameter quirks —
  verify, don't assume compatibility when swapping.

## Streaming and the agent loop

- Handle the full event grammar: partial deltas, tool-use blocks
  interleaved with text, stop reasons (max_tokens mid-JSON!), and error
  events mid-stream. Test the abort path — a client disconnect
  mid-generation must clean up.
- Agent loops need: an iteration cap, per-tool timeouts, a token/cost
  budget, and dedupe/idempotency on tool execution — retried turns
  re-issue tool calls (see concurrency-reasoning).
- Retries: retry transient API errors with backoff; NEVER blind-retry a
  turn whose tool side-effects may have executed.

## Cost/latency hygiene

Log tokens and cost per turn from day one — you cannot fix what you don't
attribute. Trim tool results before feeding them back (models don't need
400-row payloads). Choose the model tier per call site deliberately —
classification and extraction rarely need the flagship.
