# Data Migration Safety

Code you can roll back; data you often can't. Any change touching persisted
or wire formats gets treated as irreversible-by-default and sequenced so no
moment exists where running code can't handle the data it meets.

## The prime rule: old data lives forever

Every row/document/event written under the old shape still exists after
your deploy. Reads must tolerate: missing new fields (default them),
present old fields (ignore or map them), and malformed historical values
(degrade gracefully, never crash or wipe — a parse failure on one bad
record must not take down the collection). New required fields are only
"required" for new writes.

## Expand → migrate → contract (never in one step)

1. **Expand**: add the new column/field/shape alongside the old. Code
   writes both (or writes new, reads either). Deploy. Nothing depends on
   the new shape yet.
2. **Migrate**: backfill old records to the new shape. Verify counts.
3. **Contract**: only after all readers use the new shape and the backfill
   is verified — remove the old field/writes. This step is a separate
   deploy, days later, not minutes.

Collapsing these into one deploy creates the window where old code meets
new schema (or new code meets old data). The same sequencing applies to
API/event contracts: additive first, consumers migrate, then remove —
coordinate with every consumer you can enumerate, and assume one you can't.

## Backfill / data-fix scripts

- **Idempotent**: running it twice must be safe (filter to unmigrated
  rows; upsert, don't blind-insert). Scripts die mid-run; re-runnability is
  the recovery plan.
- **Dry run first**: a mode that reports what WOULD change (counts +
  samples) without writing. Review those counts against expectation —
  "expected ~2k rows, script says 1.4M" is the disaster caught early.
- **Batched with progress**: chunked commits, logged progress, resumable.
  One giant transaction locks the table and loses everything on failure.
- **Bounded**: an explicit WHERE clause scoping exactly the intended
  records. Fix scripts without a scope predicate eventually eat a table.
- Capture a before-image of affected rows (backup table, export) when the
  change is destructive — that's the rollback (see data-loss-guard).

## Verification gates

Before: count the affected set; back it up if destructive. After: recount
(migrated + remaining + errored must reconcile to the before-count),
spot-check samples end-to-end through the real read path (app code, not
just SQL), and watch error rates after deploy. A migration is done when the
numbers reconcile — not when the script exits 0.

## Rollback thinking

Write down, before running: "if this is wrong, how do I get back?"
Acceptable answers: restore from the before-image; the old field still
exists (expand/contract); the script's inverse is trivial and tested. If
the honest answer is "we can't" — that's a flag to surface for explicit
sign-off, not a detail to skip past (see escalate-vs-decide).

## Repo-reality check

Migrations live wherever THIS project keeps them. Match the project's
migration tooling and naming; never apply ad-hoc schema changes that bypass
the project's migration history.
